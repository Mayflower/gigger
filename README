A javascript library for realtime monitoring of modern web applications.

= Requirements = 
node.js
npm (comes with newer node versions)
faye ('npm install faye')

= Usage =
start the faye server: 'node server/server.js'
include require.js in your webapp and add following snippet:

<script type="text/javascript" src="require.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	// make sure developerlib.js can be found by adapting the base URL
	require.config({baseUrl: "scripts"});
	require(["developerlib"], function(developerlib) {
		// adapt the path to faye
		gigger = new developerlib.Gigger("http://faye.node.vm:8000/faye");
	});
</script>

you can now include the monitorlib in the same way in your monitor application
and start dispatching eventRequests. See gigger/monitor/monitor.html for some
examples.

== Build ==
node r.js -o scripts/gigger.build.js
